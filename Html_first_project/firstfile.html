    <h4>What is Burger?</h4>
    <p>
      A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a
      sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually
      beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan
      fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled
    </p>

    <h4>What is Fries?</h4>
    <p>
      French fries are long, thin pieces of potato fried in oil or fat. The
      French fries were thin and crispy. To cook the French fries, put them into
      a deep pan of oil.

    <h4>What is Pizza?</h4>
    <p>
      Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread
      dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives,
      mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked
      quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated
      to a very high temperature—and served hot
    </p>

    <p>
      Your typical Crunchwrap—insofar as a Crunchwrap can be typical—has a layer
      of ground beef and nacho cheese, topped witha tostada shell, and finished
      with shredded iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, and sour cream, all
      enshrouded in ahexagonally folded and griddled flour tortilla.

    <h3>5. Tiktok Ramen</h3>
    <img src="./foods/tiktokramen.jpg" width="30%" alt="Tiktok Ramen" />
    <p>
      Tiktok ramen is saucy, slightly sweet, full of umami, and really good. The
      flavors kind of remind me of an extra garlicky version of one of my all
      time favorite instant noodles: Indomie Mi Goreng, which is a take on
      Indonesian fried noodles. I feel like everyone has their own favorite way
      of making instant ramen
    </p>

    <h3>5. Caramel Apple Tart</h3>
    <img src="./foods/caramel.jpg" width="30%" alt="Caramel Apple Tart" />
    <p>
      Caramel apples or toffee apples are whole apples covered in a layer of
      caramel. They are created by dipping or rolling apples-on-a-stick in hot
      caramel, sometimes then rolling them in nuts or other small savories or
      confections, and allowing them to cool.
